# QTM-Practicum
**Emory University Quantitative Theory &amp; Methods Department: Data Science for Social Good Practicum**

**Goal:**
- Forecast a population growth model until 2050 to aid the Atlanta Regional Commission with efficient distribution of funds to counties in Atlantaâ€™s Metro 11 Area.

**Skills:**
- Python
- GitHub
- R


**Observations & Recomendations:**
- Used three different data sources: Tax, Census, American Community Survey (ACS)
- Investigated other proxies alongside formula:
  - Current Population + Births - Deaths + (Move In - Move Out)
- Through summary statistics, found that Fulton County is the largest county and many residents move there
  - Despite this, the population in certain years between the sources show a discrepancy for this important county
  - Need to fix this, as Fulton County will play a crucial role in providing a good estimate for population growth in Atlanta
